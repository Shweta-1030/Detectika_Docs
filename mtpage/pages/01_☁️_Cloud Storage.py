st.markdown("""Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS) is a subsidiary of Amazon that provides on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to individuals, 
companies, and governments, on a metered, pay-as-you-go basis. Oftentimes, clients will use this in combination with autoscaling (a process that allows a 
client to use more computing in times of high application usage, and then scale down to reduce costs when there is less traffic). These cloud computing web 
services provide various services related to networking, compute, storage, middleware, IoT and other processing capacity, as well as software tools via AWS 
server farms. This frees clients from managing, scaling, and patching hardware and operating systems. One of the foundational services is Amazon Elastic 
Compute Cloud (EC2), which allows users to have at their disposal a virtual cluster of computers, with extremely high availability, which can be interacted 
with over the internet via REST APIs, a CLI or the AWS console. AWS's virtual computers emulate most of the attributes of a real computer, including hardware 
central processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs) for processing; local/RAM memory; hard-disk/SSD storage; a choice of operating systems; 
networking; and pre-loaded application software such as web servers, databases, and customer relationship management (CRM).""")

st.markdown("""Google Cloud Platform (GCP), offered by Google, is a suite of cloud computing services that runs on the same infrastructure that Google uses internally for 
its end-user products, such as Google Search, Gmail, Google Drive, and YouTube.[2][disputed – discuss] Alongside a set of management tools, it provides a 
series of modular cloud services including computing, data storage, data analytics and machine learning.[3] Registration requires a credit card or bank 
account details.Google Cloud Platform provides infrastructure as a service, platform as a service, and serverless computing environments.
In April 2008, Google announced App Engine, a platform for developing and hosting web applications in Google-managed data centers, which was the first cloud 
computing service from the company. The service became generally available in November 2011. Since the announcement of App Engine, Google added multiple cloud
services to the platform. Google Cloud Platform is a part[5] of Google Cloud, which includes the Google Cloud Platform public cloud infrastructure, as well as
Google Workspace (G Suite), enterprise versions of Android and ChromeOS, and application programming interfaces (APIs) for machine learning and enterprise 
mapping services.

st.markdown("""Microsoft Azure, often referred to as Azure (/ˈæʒər, ˈeɪʒər/ AZH-ər, AY-zhər, UK also /ˈæzjʊər, ˈeɪzjʊər/ AZ-ure, AY-zure), is a cloud computing platform run 
by Microsoft, which offers access, management, and development of applications and services through global data centers. It provides a range of capabilities, 
including software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and infrastructure as a service (IaaS). Microsoft Azure supports many programming 
languages, tools, and frameworks, including Microsoft-specific and third-party software and systems.Microsoft's cloud computing platform, Azure, was introduced
at the Professional Developers Conference (PDC) in October 2008 under the codename "Project Red Dog". It was officially launched as Windows Azure in February 
2010 and later renamed Microsoft Azure on March 25, 2014.""")
